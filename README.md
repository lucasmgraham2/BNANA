# BNANA
This is a 2D platformer game with the goal of collecting bananas and pineapples. Be careful though because when you die, you lose all of them! Beat the three levels and come out on top as a true gorilla. The controls are A, D, and Spacebar for movement. Have fun and beat the game! This was developed in Unity.
This was created with the help of the tutorial series provided by CodingInFlow.
